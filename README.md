# The Agile Approach

On my Github repository "pp5 frontend", you can find all of my user stories listed under the issues tab. While in the planning stage of this project, I wrote out all of the stories first. I listed the acceptance criteria for each, along with attaching a label with the amount of story points each one represents. Throughout the development, I adjusted the amount of points for certain user stories as some functionality took me longer than previously anticipated.
I have found that using the kanban board feature on Github has been very helpful for me to keep track of which story I am focusing on at any given time. Also as this project is quite substantial in its requirements, I found that moving over stories from "In-progress" to "Done" helped me to break down the work into smaller bite size chunks. This really helped to prevent me from getting overwhelmed with the amount of functionality I still had left to implement at times.

List some "Epics" here maybe and link them to the corresponding user stories completed to implement the feature..
eg   Epic = User Authentication | User stories = login/logout/signup/signin using socials 
If you have time, maybe make flowchart thingy showing the relationships between them.

Any other Agile info to include?
Sprints?

# Languages/Libraries Used 

### Django Rest Framework 

- Check if i need a seperate readme for the backend?
- If not, outline details of it here

### React JS

- Built using hooks, fucntional components etc etc 
- Anything else to add?

### React-Bootstrap

- used some standard components here 
- Added your own custom CSS to customise further and make your application more unique 

### CSS

- To add my own custom styles alongside bootstrap classes

### Cloudinary 

- Used for image file storage 
- Using an ephemeral file system would result in my image files being deleted after two weeks. To prevent this from happening, I used cloudinary for my image files storage. It keeps the project cleaner by storing the files this way.

### Django Authentication or is it something else?
